# 1. Introduction to git commits.

Task: The task is to make two commits. 

Solution: git commit 

	    git commit

Examination: The git commit command takes a snapshot of all staged changes to the repository. 

# 2. Branching in git.

Task: The task is to make a new branch named bugFix and switch to that branch.

Solution: git checkout -b bugfix 

Examination: The command git checkout -b bugfix makes a new branch named bugFix and switches to that branch at the same time. 

# 3. Merging in git.

Task: The task is to make a new branch named bugFix and merge the branch bugFix into main. 

Solution: git checkout – b bugFix 

	   git commit 

	   git checkout main 

	   git commit 

	   git merge bugFix

Examination: The solution creates a branch bugFix and commits any changes in the branch. Then it switches to main branch and commits any changes made in main. The git merge bugFix merges the bugFix branch to main branch. 

# 4. Rebase Introduction.

Task: The task is to create a branch named bugFix, commit once, go back to main, commit once, checkout to bugFix and rebase to main. 

Solution: git checkout – b bugFix

	git commit 

	git checkout main 

	git commit 

	git checkout bugFix

	git rebase main

Examination: The solution creates a new branch bugFix, commits changes in both the bugFix branch and the main branch and then rebases the bug fix branch onto the main branch making it as if the changes in bugFix were made on top of the current state of main.

# 5. Detach head

Task: The task is to attach the head to commit. 

Solution: git checkout c4 

Examination: The command git checkout c4 attaches the head to the c4 commit. 

# 6. Relative Refs ^

Task: The task is to find the parent commit of bugFix using relative refs.

Solution: git checkout bugFix^

Examination: The command checks and shows the parent commit of bugFix. 

# 7. Relative Refs ~

Task: The task is to move head, main and bugFix to their goal destination. 

Solution: git branch -f main C6 

	Git checkout HEAD ~1

	Git branch -f bugFix HEAD~1

Examination: The command ‘git branch -f main C6’ forcefully updates the main branch to commit C6. The command ‘Git checkout HEAD ~1’ will check out the commit that is one step before the current commit. The command ‘Git branch -f bugFix HEAD~1’ is used to forcefully update the bugFix branch to point to the commit that is one step before the current commit. 

# 8. Reversing changes in git 

Task: The task is to reset local and revert pushed. 

Solution: git reset HEAD~1

	Git checkout pushed 

	Git revert HEAD 

Examination: The command ‘git reset HEAD~1’ is used to move local back to the commit that is one step before the local commit. The command ‘git checkout pushed git revert HEAD’ is to change the working directory to the pushed branch and then create a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the most recent commit.

# 9. Cherry pick intro 

Task: The task is to cherry-[ick three commits. 

Solution: git cherry-pick C3 C4 C7

Examination: The command ‘git cherry-pick C3 C4 C7’ allows one to selectively apply the changes from the commits to the current branch. 

# 10. rebase -I 

Task: The task is to rebase in the order shown.

Solution: git rebase -i overHere 

Examination: The command ‘git rebase -i overHere’ allows you to interactively reapply the commits from your current branch onto the overHere branch, giving you control over the handling of each commit.

# 11. Grabbing just 1 commit 

Task: The task is to copy only one of the commits over.

Solution: git checkout main

	Git cherry-pick C4 

	Or

	Git rebase -i main

	Git rebase bugFix main 

Examination: The command git cherry pick or git rebase can both be used to copy the single commit over. The command git cherry pick applies the changes  from the c4 

commit to the main branch. 

# 12. Juggling Commits.

Task: The task is to make slight changes in the earlier commit and re-order the commit back to how they previously were. 

Solution: git rebase -i HEAD~2

	Git commit –amend

	Git rebase -i HEAD~2 

	Git rebase caption main 

Examination: We use the command ‘git rebase-I HEAD~2’ command to rebase and reorder the C2 and C3 commit. Then we amend the commit to make the changes in C2. Then we 

perform git rebase again to reorder the commit. Then we rebase main to the updated part of the tree. 

# 13. Juggling Commits #2

Task: The task is to use git cherry pick to reorder commits. 

Solution: git checkout c1

	Git cherry-pick c2

	Git checkout main

	Git cherry-pick c2 c3 

Examination: The solution picks the referenced commit and append it to the current working head. 

# 14. Git tags 

Task: The task is to create tags in the goal visualizations and check v1 out.

Solution: git checkout c2

	Git tag v0 c1

	Git tag v1 c2

Examination: The command git tag creates a milestone for the specified commit. 

# 15. Git describe 

Task: The task is to describe a few of the locations using git describe. 

Solution: git describe bugFix 

	Git describe main 

	Git describe side 

	Git commit 

Examination: The command git describe finds the most recent tag that is reachable from the referenced commit. 

# 16. Rebasing multiple branches 

Task: The task is to rebase multiple branches in a sequential order. 

Solution: git rebase main bugFix

	Git rebase bugFix side

	Git rebase side another 

	Git rebase another main 

Examination: The commands rebases the commits in the specified order. It Integrates changes from main into bugFix, then integrate bugFix into side, then integrate side 

into another, and finally integrate another back into main.

# 17. Specifying parents 

Task: The task is to specify commit using modifier. 

Solution: git branch bugWork main ^^2^

Examination: The command git branch bugWork main ^^2^ creates a new branch named bugWork from the commit that is two parents before the second parent of the main 
branch's current commit.

# 18. Branch Spaghetti 

Task: The task is to update the three branches with modified version of last few commits on main. 

Solution: git checkout one 

	Git cherry pick c4 c3 c2 

	Git checkout two 

	Git cherry pick c5 c4 c3 c2 

	Git rebase c2 three

Examination: The command updates the branches as specified.
